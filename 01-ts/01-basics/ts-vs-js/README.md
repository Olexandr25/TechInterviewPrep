# TypeScript vs JavaScript

This section explains the differences between TypeScript and JavaScript.

- **TypeScript:**
  - Superset of JavaScript with static typing.
  - Catches errors at compile time.
  - Supports modern JS features and additional tools (interfaces, enums, etc).
- **JavaScript:**
  - Dynamically typed language.
  - Errors are caught at runtime.
  - Runs natively in browsers and Node.js.

TypeScript improves code quality and maintainability, especially for large projects.
