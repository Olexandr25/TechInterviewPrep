# Useful Packages

TypeScript has a rich ecosystem of packages that extend the language or add functionality to your project. Here is a list of the most useful packages:

- **zod**
  TypeScript-first data validation library.
  `npm install zod`
  Used for type-safe validation of objects, APIs, and forms.

- **ts-morph**
  API for manipulating TypeScript code at the AST level.
  `npm install ts-morph`
  Useful for code generation, analysis, and refactoring.

- **ts-node**
  Run TypeScript code directly in Node.js, REPL for TypeScript.
  `npm install ts-node`
  Allows you to execute `.ts` files without prior compilation.

- **ts-jest**
  Jest transformer with source map support, enables testing of TypeScript projects.
  `npm install ts-jest`
  Integrates Jest with TypeScript for unit testing.

- **typesync**
  Automatically installs missing type definitions for dependencies from package.json.
  `npm install typesync`
  Helps maintain type safety for all npm packages.

- **tsd**
  Manager for testing and verifying TypeScript types.
  `npm install tsd`
  Used for writing type tests in libraries.

- **type-fest**
  Collection of useful utility types for TypeScript.
  `npm install type-fest`
  Includes types for working with objects, functions, strings, and more.

## How to use

- Install the required package via npm.
- Read the documentation for integration into your project.
- Use types, utilities, or APIs to extend TypeScript capabilities.

## Good to know

- Most packages are actively maintained and well-documented.
- They add type safety, automation, and convenience to development.
- Can be used in both applications and libraries.

## Interview questions

- What packages are useful for working with TypeScript?
- How can you automatically install type definitions for npm dependencies?
- What is the purpose of ts-node or ts-jest?

## What to answer

- TypeScript has many useful packages for validation, testing, running code, and working with types.
- Installing and integrating packages greatly simplifies development.
- Some packages (type-fest, zod) improve type safety and data handling convenience.

## Tricky points

- Some packages may conflict with each other.
- You need to keep track of updates and version compatibility.
- Not all packages are equally useful for every type of project.
