# Omit

`Omit<T, K>` is a utility type in TypeScript that creates a new type by excluding properties `K` from type `T`. It is the opposite of `Pick<T, K>`.

## Example

```typescript
interface Todo {
  title: string;
  description: string;
  completed: boolean;
  createdAt: number;
}

type TodoPreview = Omit<Todo, 'description'>;

const todo: TodoPreview = {
  title: 'Clean room',
  completed: false,
  createdAt: 1615544252770,
};
```

## How to use

- To create types without certain properties.
- When you need to hide sensitive or service fields.

## Common use cases

- To create request types without autogenerated fields (`id`, `createdAt`).
- When working with APIs — hiding passwords, tokens.
- For forms — excluding readonly fields.

## Good to know

- `K` can be a single key or a union of keys.
- Equivalent to `Pick<T, Exclude<keyof T, K>>`.
- Opposite of `Pick<T, K>`.

## Rarely used

- Combining with other utility types.
- Using with computed property names.

## Interview questions

- What does `Omit<T, K>` do?
- What is the difference between `Omit` and `Pick`?
- How to implement your own `Omit`?

### What to answer

- `Omit<T, K>` excludes properties `K` from type `T`.
- `Omit` removes fields, `Pick` selects specific fields.
- Implemented via `Pick<T, Exclude<keyof T, K>>`.

## Tricky points

- If key `K` does not exist in `T` — no error, nothing changes.
- `Omit` preserves the original types of the remaining properties.
- Can be combined with other utility types: `Omit<Partial<T>, K>`.
