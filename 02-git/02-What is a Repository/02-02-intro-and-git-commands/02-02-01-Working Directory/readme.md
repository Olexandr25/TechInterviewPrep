# Working Directory

The working directory in Git is the local folder where project files are stored and modified. It reflects the current state of the files, allowing developers to edit, add, or delete files.

Changes made in the working directory can be staged (prepared for commit), after which they are added to the repository. The working directory is connected to the Git repository and helps track the difference between the saved history (committed history) and the current state of the files.

The working directory is the central place for development, testing, and creating new features.
