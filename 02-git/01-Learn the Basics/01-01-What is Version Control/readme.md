# What is Version Control?

Version control is a system that manages and tracks changes to files over time, allowing multiple people to collaborate on a project and maintain a history of all modifications. It records changes to files (code, documents, configurations) and stores them in a repository.

Thanks to version control, developers can:

- Restore previous versions of files.
- Compare different versions and see the evolution of a project.
- Use branches for independent development of new features or bug fixes.
- Merge changes from different branches.

Version control provides organization, recoverability, and easy management of changes, making it a critically important tool in software development and team projects.
