# Why use Version Control?

Version control is an essential tool for managing changes in software development. It allows you to:

- Track all changes in code and documentation.
- Collaborate with multiple developers on a single project without risking overwriting each other's work.
- Keep a history of changes: who, when, and why the code was modified.
- Roll back the project to a previous version in case of errors or bugs.
- Use branches for experiments, new features, bug fixes, and different development stages.
- Improve code quality, transparency, and accountability within the team.
